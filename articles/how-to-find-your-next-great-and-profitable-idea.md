## How to find you next great and profitable idea, 40 ways


### 1. Scratch Your Own Itch
Solve a problem you have, especially one that feels niche but painful. This could be really difficult as many of us don't have any problems, especially hackers. But I believe, that we actually have problems, we are just used to theim in hard way. 
#### Example 1. 
How many times you are stuck with a Git? You made some changes, tried to commit, and suddenly you see an error that you don't understand. You can try to find an answer on Stackoverlow, ask ChatGPT but it still may be hard and scary to follow their suggestions. So, what if you build a tool that...
- doesn't allow you to screw with Git
- show visually in simple manner what's going on (even if you a newbie with Git)
- teach you Git's basics
- convert your plain English in series of correct Git commands?

**Advice.** If you don't have any problems, talk to you relatives, friends, colleagues - don't ask them directly "What do you have a problem with?" but rather listen to their complaints and watch their daily activities.

### 2. Talk to People in a Niche
Especially those in boring industries — logistics, insurance, compliance, etc. May be you have a friend or spouse working in those industries, or you met them while using their services and saw them struggling with existing tools? Look at their websites, try their apps, and you will be surprised how bad and slow they could be.

### 3. Ask "Why is this still done manually?"
Find areas still stuck in spreadsheets or pen and paper. One of my friends that is keen on in flight clubs, found that most of the club's owners still manage their assets and members using paper and pen, many of them never thought it could be done differently.

#### Examples:
- apps for cleaning services
- veterinary clinic records (convert manually written records to the electronic versions)

### 4. Look for Hacks People Use
Temporary workarounds often hide product ideas. For example, you can read here and there the posts like "How I connect make.com with Notion to create a simple, private CRM" - this hack could be an idea for a "CRM for Notion". Look similar hacks on the Internet, in the Reddit subs, on Twitter, and other resources.

### 5. Explore B2B Software Graveyards
Find outdated software with loyal customers, build a better version. 
#### Examples
Many small businesses run essential internal tools off Access or QuickBase — they can’t find modern replacements that are simple and flexible enough. So, it could be a simple visual database builder with views, user roles, forms, and reports. Targets businesses that want something better than Excel but not full dev tools.

### 6. Build for Trends
AI, remote work, creator economy, digital health, etc. Ride the wave. The trick is not just to build for a trend, but to build with the trend — by solving emerging problems it creates.

#### Examples
- AI prompt library for lawyers, HR pros, or therapists
- AI guardrails SaaS for enterprises — prevent LLMs from leaking sensitive data
- Loom + AI → Auto-summary and task extraction from video updates
- “Stripe Atlas for Creators” — LLC, tax help, payouts in one
- Micro-therapy SaaS — 5-minute sessions + journaling with AI summarization
- HIPAA-compliant messaging for small clinics — cheaper, cleaner Slack alternative

### 7. Use "X for Y" Formula
“Uber for boats”, “Notion for lawyers”, “Slack for churches” — surprisingly works. To make interesting combinations, try this free service: [https://www.toptal.com/marketing/mergewords](https://www.toptal.com/marketing/mergewords).

### 8. Check SaaS marketplaces
See what’s selling on platforms like AppSumo, G2, or Product Hunt. With services like G2 and Capterra, look for interesting (to you) categories and read the negative reviews. They will give you an idea what people lack in those apps, what they complain about.

### 9. Reverse Startup Funding
Read what VCs are funding and try to build it leaner, earlier, or cheaper. Here is the list of YC-baked startups: [https://www.ycombinator.com/companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies).

### 10. Fix Something Broken in a Big Tool 
A better Stripe dashboard? Cleaner Google Docs alternative?
#### Examples:
- a simpler Vercel or DigitalOcean (what if you can host your project in just 2 clicks?)
- a simpler database/project management
- a simpler Git.
